# Freemocap Adapter
Add-on to adapt the Freemocap Blender output. It can adjust the empties position, add a rig and a body mesh. The resulting rig and animation can be imported in platforms like Unreal Engine.

# Requirements
1. Activate the Rigify add-on in Blender preferences.

# Installation
Install as a regular *.zip add-on in Edit->Preferences-Add-ons.

# Considerations:
The rig has a TPose as rest pose for easier retargeting.
For best results, when the adjust empties function is executed the empties should be forming a standing still pose with arms open similar to A or T Pose.

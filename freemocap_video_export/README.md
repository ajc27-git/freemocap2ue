# Freemocap Video Export Blender Addon
Blender addon for exporting the output of Freemocap. Choose a profile and click the export button. The export range will be determined by the scene range.

## Installation
Install the .zip file as a normal Blender addon.

## Considerations
If the scene range is left as default the addon will fail as the last frame has no animation data. Adjust the range so the last frame is not considered.

## Requirements
1. Add the files freemocap_logo.png and charuco_board.png to the same folder where the .blend file is located.
